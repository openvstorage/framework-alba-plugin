"""
The Open vStorage Data Access Layer contains hybrid objects, providing a transparent access method
for data that consists of persistent model objects extended with extra reality properties coverd by
a caching layer.

Most Open vStorage objects contain certain data that is used in the Open vStorage engine. However,
since various objects have properties that are managed by third party components, the architecture
is designed in such way that those properties are stored/managed by the components themself. A
great example here is "disk", which contains metadata like 'name' or 'description' that are owned
by the Open vStorage engine. However, it also contains properties like 'used size' which is managed
by the volume driver.

To provide a single point of access to this data, hybrid objects are provided. In the above
scenario, a hybrid "disk" object has properties 'name', 'description' and 'used_size'. Where the
first two are backed by a persistent storage layer, and the last one by the volumedriver.

To provide fast access without too much overhead, an additional caching layer is added. When an
object is requested, it will be retreived from cache first, and if not available, retreived from
the persistent storage. The reality properties have individual caching settings which allows every
property cache timeout to be configured individually.
